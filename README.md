# osu! Beatmap Tuner

Experimental project to make something similar to FunOrange's [osu trainer](https://github.com/FunOrange/osu-trainer).

Currently supports command-line arguments to generate modified osu! beatmaps. 

`Input:` { beatmap file (.osz) }

`Output:` { modified beatmap-difficulty file (.osu), modified audio file (.wav) }
